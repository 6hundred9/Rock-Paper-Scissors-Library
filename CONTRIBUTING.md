## How to contribute to the Rock-Paper-Scissors library

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/6hundred9/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lbrary/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/6hundred9/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lbrary/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your changes in the [Github discussions tab](https://github.com/6hundred9/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Library/discussions/1) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Ruby on Rails in the [Github discussions tab]([https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/c/rubyonrails-talk](https://github.com/6hundred9/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Library/discussions/2)).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Rails documentation?**

* Please make sure that the community would actually like the change

* Make sure that the new update wouldn't break already existing projects

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
